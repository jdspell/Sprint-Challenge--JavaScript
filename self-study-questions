1. forEach modifies the array that it iterates over while map creates a new array. Additionally, forEach returns undefined whereas map returns an array of the size as the one it iterates over.

2. A method is a function, but it is a function that belongs to an object giving the object some added ability.

3. Closure occurs when a function returns another function. The returned function then has access to all the variables of the function that returned it(remembers the outer function's state).

4. Window binding-when the other types of bindings are not performed this is the global/window object   
   Implicit binding-when inside a function and dot notation is used to provide this it's context
   Explicit binding-when .call is used to explicitly tell this where to point
   new  binding- when the new keyword is used to tell this to point at an object

5. Super allows for the parent constructor to be called so that all the parameters that were passed to the child class can be dealt with.
